<h1 align="center">Lifeguard Beaches and Beach Safety</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://greggo58.github.io/CI-MS1-LifeguardBeaches/)

This site hopes to be a hub of information for lifeguard beaches located in South East England. The primary focus will be to provide weather and beach locations with lifeguards on duty. Secondary focus will be on marine safety equipment for watersports; to showcase public beach events about lifesaving such as public demonstrations, safety seminars, and competitions. The site is targeted at the general public: young people wishing to compete or become a lifesaver, parents / adults wanting to enjoy their time on the beach with family in relative safety, marine sports enthusiasts, and lifesavers.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   Core colour: #e50000 [Lifeguard Red](https://icolorpalette.com/color/lifeguard-red)
        -   Palette selection based on core colour: [Matching Gradient](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23E50000&sub=1)
            -   #E50000 #F70068 #D217BF #5A66FE #0088FF #0097E8
        - CSS Color Gradient: [ColorSpace 3-Color Gradient](https://mycolor.space/gradient3) `background-image: linear-gradient(to right top, #e50000, #f10031, #f60054, #f50075, #ec0095, #e020ad, #ce36c5, #b549da, #9a5eea, #7b6ff5, #537dfc, #0088ff);`
    -   #### Typography
        -   Font pairing: [2020 Most Popular Fonts](https://govisually.com/blog/2020s-top-20-google-font-pairs-for-your-next-project/)
        -   Montserrat | Oswald - "The Monsterrat font was designed in agreement with the urban typography of the 20th century. The generous spacing between the letters is one of the striking characteristics of this font and makes it so convenient to follow. On the other hand, the Oswald font is known for its narrow appearance in spacing and letters. Together, they make an ideal impact in the mind of viewers."
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
